### Counter's Thready Safety  
* 01_01 [Thread Safety Counter via Member Variable MutexLockGuard Source]()
```cpp

int64_t Counter::value() const {
    MutexLockGuard lock(mutex_);   
    return value_; 
}
```

`MutexLockGuard` is a RAII(Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) style lock which is usually adopted in scoped mutex managed area. The key idea of the RAII is retrieve resources(like the lock) in object's construct method, and release resources(like the lock) in object's desctructor method. 

Here are the steps of this fraction of code:

* Step-1: Constructor of `MutexLockGuard` retrieve the lock 
When entering `MutexLockGuard`'s constructor will lock the `mutex_`instance of `MutexLock`. 

* Step-2: Function `value()`'s execute
The remain logic in the function `value()` will be executed while the lock is holding. 
The lock will not be released until `return value_` return the value of `value_`.
During this period any threads that trying to retrieve the instance of `mutex_` will be blocked. 

* Step-3: Destructor of `MutexLockGuard` release the lock 
Before the return of the function `Counter::value()` the `MutexLockGuard` object the `lock` will be destoried (since it is a function scoped varible that should be destoried before the return of the function).

When `lock` destroying it will invoke the destructor function in which the `mutex_` will be released. 
In this way the lock can maintain the function's inner variables cannot be accessed by other threads, every threads that trying to retrieve the `mutex_` will be set blocked. 

When the `mutex_` is released in the `MutexLockGuard`'s destruction function, the blocked(queued) threads will be invoked to scramble for the `mutex_`.
